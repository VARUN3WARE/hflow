"""The FastAPI app (pure, testable) and the ``hflow serve`` server entry point.

``create_app`` builds the whole API plus SPA serving from one
:class:`ServerSettings` -- no sockets, no side effects. ``serve`` adds the launch
behavior: pick a free port, print the URL, open the browser, run uvicorn. The
server authenticates nobody: whoever can reach the bound address gets the
whole API (docs/SERVE.md, "Trust posture"). The only workspace files this package
ever writes are the curation studio's: immutable pinned manifests under
``<data_root>/manifests/`` and the ``<data_root>/curation/state.json`` sidecar (both
refused when ``settings.read_only``); the server never mints workspace
identity.
