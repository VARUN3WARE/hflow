"""The published JSON contract: one model per payload this API serves.

The API is the product surface -- the shipped SPA is only its reference
client, and third parties (increasingly coding agents) build against the
schema at ``/api/openapi.json`` (the schema JSON is the whole published docs
surface -- FastAPI's Swagger page is disabled because it loads from a CDN).
So every route declares a model from this module as its response type instead
of hand-building a dict: the model is the ONE owner of that payload's field
names and types, and the generated OpenAPI describes what actually goes over
the wire.

Four shapes stay deliberately open, each because another module owns it and
a mirror here could only drift:

- rows of the wide ``episodes`` view and of a user's own SELECT -- their
  columns ARE data, described alongside the rows by :class:`ColumnDescriptor`;
- DuckDB ``SUMMARIZE`` rows, whose key set varies by DuckDB version;
- the pipeline manifest, owned and version-stamped by ``hflow.manifest``;
- a dag run's ``conf`` (:class:`RuntimeRunSummary`), which is whatever the
  trigger sent -- ``hflow.runtime.AirflowClient.ingest`` owns the shape of
  the ones this API mints, but a run started from Airflow's own UI can carry
  anything, so no model here could describe it honestly.

Nullability follows the catalog's DDL (``hflow.catalog.TABLE_COLUMN_DDL``),
which declares no NOT NULL: a field a stored row could carry as NULL is typed
nullable, so odd data is served honestly instead of turning into a 500 from
response validation.

Two of these models are also the sidecar's ON-DISK shape
(:class:`SavedQueryEntry`, :class:`PinnedManifestEntry`) -- and so is
everything they nest (:class:`CheckCoverageEntry`): ``_sidecar`` stores
exactly what the API serves, so the registry a user can read with ``jq`` and
the payload the API returns can never disagree. Changing any of them
therefore changes the stored format, which ``_sidecar.STATE_VERSION`` guards.
